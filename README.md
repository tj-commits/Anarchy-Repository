Any pull requests you make are automatically merged by github-actions, unless you delete the workflow in the changes you make in your fork, or the github-actions won't let you if you modify this readme. Im ready for the chaos.

Important
For some reason, some pullrequests aren't merged automatically. if this happens, I will merge them myself soon.

**IMPORTANT!**
GitHub has this option called workflow approval where you can choose when the repository owner has to approve workflows on PRs. There's no way to disable it however, sadly, the only option is disable approval for all but first-time contributors. So **if you have never contributed to GitHub before, the PR will not automatically merge.** However, I check my notifications all the time, so I may merge it myself.
