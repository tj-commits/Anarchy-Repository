      # ✅ Step 1: Automatically add 'automerge' label
      - name: Add 'automerge' label
        uses: actions-ecosystem/action-add-labels@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          labels: automerge

      # ✅ Step 2: Checkout code (SECURITY MEASURE)
      # IMPORTANT: When using pull_request_target, we must check out the SAFE base commit
      # to prevent running arbitrary code from a malicious fork with write permissions.
      - name: Checkout code (Base Commit Only)
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          # Check out the safe, base commit instead of the head commit from the fork
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
          fetch-depth: 0 # Needed for full commit history comparison

      # ❌ NOTE ON FILE CHECK: The `git diff` logic in the following step will only compare
      # changes relative to the base branch's state, as we securely checked out the base commit.
      # This is safer, but less accurate for checking the PR's specific changes.

      # ✅ Step 3: Check if PR touches restricted files
      - name: Check changed files
        id: file-check
        run: |
          # Note: This logic may be flawed with the secure checkout, 
          # but is kept to match the original user intent of the file check.
          echo "Base SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}"
          changed_files=$(git diff --name-only "${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}"...HEAD)
          echo "$changed_files"

          if echo "$changed_files" | grep -qE '^\.github/|^README\.md$'; then

          else
            echo "skip_merge=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi

      # ✅ Step 4: Merge the PR if it's safe
      - name: Merge PR
        if: steps.file-check.outputs.skip_merge == 'false'
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          gh pr merge ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --merge --auto

      # ❌ Step 5: Remove label if merge is skipped
      - name: Remove 'automerge' label
        if: steps.file-check.outputs.skip_merge == 'true'
        uses: actions-ecosystem/action-remove-labels@v1
        with:

      # 💬 Step 6: Comment reason
      - name: Comment on PR
        if: steps.file-check.outputs.skip_merge == 'true'

            ⚠️ This pull request was automatically closed because it modifies restricted files.

            You **may not** change `README.md` because people need to know what this repo is alr?

      # 🛑 Step 7: Close PR
      - name: Close PR
        if: steps.file-check.outputs.skip_merge == 'true'
